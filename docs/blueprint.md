## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong teal (#008080) to convey trust, reliability, and forward-thinking.
- Background color: Light greenish-gray (#E0E5E5). It is closely matched to the teal, while remaining light enough for a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Soft cyan (#70DBDB) to provide clear visual cues and highlights; an analogous color is used that offers a good contrast, but remains aligned in tone.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers to give a contemporary, geometric look and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body to optimize readability.
- Use simple, geometric icons related to sales, leads, and business.
- The landing page should be clean and sectioned with clear CTAs and a logical flow of information.
- Subtle transitions and animations on key interactions.
